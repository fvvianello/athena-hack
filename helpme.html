           <p>Plastic bags cannot easily be recycled. There are many plastic bags floating in the sea and animals like Marlin can get trapped in them. </p>
           <p>Therefore, we should try to minimise the number of plastic bags. </p>
           <p></p>
           <p>We can do this by reusing plastic bags we already have or by using a different type of reusable bag such as one made in fabric. </p>

          <div id="BottlesText">
          <p>Most plastic bottles can be recycled but be careful! Did you know you have to remove the lid of most bottles before recycling them as these can often not be recycled. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p> Tip: Reduce your plastic waste by using reusable bottles. Glass bottles are less harmful to the environment compared to plastic bottles.</p>

          <h2> Food packaging </h2>
          <img src="images/food_containers.jpg" width="300">
          <div id="FoodWasteText">
          <p>Only some food packaging can be recycled. The packaging that can go into the recycling bin will have the recycling sign.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Be careful !! Some packing will have parts that can be recycled and other parts that cannot be recycled. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For example, the plastic yogurt container might be recyclable but the lid or the plastic used to seal the container might not be recyclable. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p> In this case, separate the lid from the container and throw the lid in the normal bin while the container can be thrown in the recycle bin.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p> You can minimise your waste by reusing food containers and going to zero watse grocery shops. Check the map in the Clean city tab for you local zero waste shops. </p>

          <p> Many items in your home will have batteries (clocks, toys, etc.). These batteries can be very harmful to the environment. Therefore, we should try our best to recycle them.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p> You can bring your batteries to most local grocery shops. </p>
